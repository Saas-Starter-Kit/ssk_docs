Welcome to the Saas Starterkit Docs.

Saas Startkit is a modern React and Nodejs SAAS boilerplate.

There are 2 versions, the free open source as well as a paid Pro version.

The only setup required for the free open source version is Firebase, the rest of the setups and documentation mainly applies to the Pro Version.

This documentation will help you setup and get the boilerplate running, which only requires defining the environment variables.

Detailed explanations are also given throughout to help the user better understand the boilerplate in addition to setting it up.
