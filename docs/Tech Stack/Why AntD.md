Ant D is the fastest growing React component library by popularity and currently sits at the number 2 spot right behind material-ui.

Due to its meteoric rise, it is not unreasonable to think that it will most likely overtake material ui as the most popular React component library in the near future.

Ant D is great because its styling is minimal and elegant. Which allows for easy overriding of styles or integration into most projects without any additional styling.

In comparison material-ui is heavily styled and distinctive. Overriding styles is not easy and requires much more involvement. You also canâ€™t just drop in material ui components without matching the style to your app, since the very distinctly styled material-ui components will look out of place.

Material ui has been around for a long time. There are many cheap templates for it that are used by many apps. Using material-ui will make your app look like it was built with a cheap template rather than standing out and leaving an impression in your users mind.

There are also a lot of other lesser popular libraries, but due to their lack of popularity, there are much less resources and features for those libraries.

Therefore Ant D was chosen for this project.
