#### Sendinblue vs Mailchimp

Sendinblue is also much cheaper than mailchimp while still offering more features

Mailchimp is undoubtedly more popular with marketers but not necessarily with devs. For example, the official nodejs package of Mailchimp Marketing is @mailchimp/mailchimp_marketing, which gets around 10,000 weekly downloads. Compared to sib-api-v3-sdk, the official nodejs package, which gets around 44,000 weekly downloads.

Also tutorials and guides that show nodejs integration with Mailchimp are virtually non-existent, this is not the case with Sendinblue that has a ton of tutorials, guides and references.

centralizing all your marketing in one place will allow you to organize and streamline your marketing operations.

Sendgrid can also be easily supported, simply remove sendinblue code and add sendgrid as the transporter. Also remove the code associated with sendinblue such as creating contacts and the api call on the frontend in the confirmed email component.
