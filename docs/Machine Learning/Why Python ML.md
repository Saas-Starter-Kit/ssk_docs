Why are we using Python Machine Learning if this is a javascript project?

Python Machine Learning absolutely dwarfs Javascript machine learning in every respect. Python has won out to be the default language of choice for performance and ease of use for machine learning.

Javascript ML has nowhere near the popularity, maturity and refinement that Python ML does. Pythonâ€™s machine learning ecosystem is vast with a large amount of tutorials, guides and libraries. This makes it an ideal choice for machine learning projects.

There are many big names using Python Machine learning such as Facebook, Uber, Wells Fargo and Spotify just to name a few. Javascript ML has very few users none of which are big names.

It is quite complex to integrate 2 languages together, so it is best to have the Machine learning server as a separate API service. Since the front end is decoupled this will not be any issue whatsoever. The frontend can simply call the ML service api endpoint when it needs a ML analysis and the node server for all other tasks.
