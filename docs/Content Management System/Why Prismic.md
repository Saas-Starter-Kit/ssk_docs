Prismic is the one of the simplest CMSs for Gatsby giving you all the features you need without all the bloat.

Traditional CMSs, like Contentful, are built for large content teams where Prismic is focused on the developer.

This gives it a very great dev experience. It is very easy to use and understand.

Thanks to the modular nature of Gatsby and React you can easily replace the CMS if for some reason you want to go with another provider.

Prismic is a fairly popular CMS and used by large companies such as Google and Netflix
