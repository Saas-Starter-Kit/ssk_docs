AWS CDK is a relatively newer tool created by AWS that allows you to write infrastructure as code with typescript, python and other languages.

This results in massive productivity boosts compared to older patterns where 1000s of lines of cloudformation templates were used compared to the few hundred lines of code required by AWS CDK.

For this reason AWS CDK has absolutely exploded in popularity and it is inevitable it will become the default way to build cloud architectures in the near future.

Important to note is to keep AWS CDK cli version the same as package versions
