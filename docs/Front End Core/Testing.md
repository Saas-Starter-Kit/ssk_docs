React Testing Library along with Jest and Cypress are used on the front end for testing. It is recommended to use jest for basic component unit testing and cypress for more complex integration and end to end testing. A detailed article on React testing is linked below.

Jest tests can be run with a simple npm run test.

Cypress requires that the app is running when the cypress open command is called.

An example of both RTL with Jest and Cypress is given in the project.
