This project uses Google Analytics but goes beyond the basic page views. This project uses custom event tracking combined with User ids. This will give you a far clearer picture of how your app is actually being used by your users.

Also important to note is that this project uses Google Analytics 4 which was released in October 2020. This is slightly different and incompatible with the previous version.
