This project uses a basic Docker setup for the server.

It is not necessary to use Docker for development. npm start can be used as normal.

Docker is more important in production where it is used by AWS Fargate which is a serverless container service. It automatically starts, stops and scales containers based on traffic.

If you donâ€™t plan on using the provided AWS Fargate configuration or working with other developers then Docker usage is not necessary.
